# Java Streams and Lambdas

## 📌 Overview
This repository contains hands-on examples and practice programs demonstrating the use of **Java Streams API** and **Lambda Expressions** introduced in Java 8.

The project focuses on writing **clean, concise, and functional-style code** to process collections efficiently.
This project uses Java Streams and Lambda expressions to efficiently process and analyze company details such as employee records, salaries, departments, and performance metrics with minimal and readable code.



## 🎯 Objectives
- Understand Lambda Expressions and functional programming concepts
- Learn Stream operations such as filter, map, reduce, and collect
- Replace traditional loops with stream-based solutions
- Improve code readability and performance
